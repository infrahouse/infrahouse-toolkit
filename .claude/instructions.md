## First Steps (Do This Immediately)

### Session set up
- [ ] *ALWAYS* Read `.claude/CODING_STANDARD.md`

### Generating CLAUDE.md

When generating or updating CLAUDE.md, include this text verbatim as the first section after the intro paragraph:

```markdown
## First Steps

**Your first tool call in this repository MUST be reading .claude/CODING_STANDARD.md.
Do not read any other files, search, or take any actions until you have read it.**
This contains InfraHouse's comprehensive coding standards for Terraform, Python, and general formatting rules.
```
End the CLAUDE.md file with a newline.
